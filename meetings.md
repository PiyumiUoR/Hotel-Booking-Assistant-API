# Meetings notes

## Meeting 1.
* **DATE: 1.2.2024**
* **ASSISTANTS: Iván Sánchez Milara**

### Minutes
In the meeting, the current version of the API description was discussed in a somewhat detailed manner. Overall, the current API description appeared a bit too technical and detailed considering the requirements set for the content at this moment. The API description is strongly focused on the functionalities and implementation of the project, and while these aspects were considered relevant, they are actually meant to be addressed later during the project. The content presented in the meeting is therefore relevant and will not need to be removed, but instead transferred elsewhere to be provided later on during the project. Finally, additional content regarding the overview, the main concepts as well as the related work of the project was requested to clarify the fundamental aspects of the project.

### Action points
1. Include motivation, e.g. possible customers and achievable benefits of the API in *Section 1: API overview*. 
2. Instead of functionalities, describe the general concepts of the API and include a diagram describing the relations between them in *Section 2: Main concepts*.
3. Include an example of a service that would utilize the API in *Section 3: API uses*.
4. Provide links to the related API examples and classify them according to the instructions in *Section 4: Related work*.
