# Meetings notes

## Meeting 1.
* **DATE: 1.2.2024**
* **ASSISTANTS: Iv치n S치nchez Milara**

### Minutes
In the meeting, the current version of the API description was discussed in a somewhat detailed manner. Overall, the current API description appeared a bit too technical and detailed considering the requirements set for the content at this moment. The API description is strongly focused on the functionalities and implementation of the project, and while these aspects were considered relevant, they are actually meant to be addressed later during the project. The content presented in the meeting is therefore relevant and will not need to be removed, but instead transferred elsewhere to be provided later on during the project. Finally, additional content regarding the overview, the main concepts as well as the related work of the project was requested to clarify the fundamental aspects of the project.

### Action points
1. Include motivation, e.g. possible customers and achievable benefits of the API in *Section 1: API overview*. 
2. Instead of functionalities, describe the general concepts of the API and include a diagram describing the relations between them in *Section 2: Main concepts*.
3. Include an example of a service that would utilize the API in *Section 3: API uses*.
4. Provide links to the related API examples and classify them according to the instructions in *Section 4: Related work*.

The discussion points in the meeting were mainly about the progress of the database design and implementation. Overall the content was ok. The README.md file did not include facts such as how to create and populate a database although the required files are attached to the repository. Since there are usernames and passwords are involved in the 'Admin' table, the API authentication should be considered during the DB implementation. The relationship between the 'Booking' to 'Room' should be changed since a single booking can have only one room. If a customer is to book multiple rooms, multiple bookings are to be made. There are many types of rooms and for validation of room types, JSON Schema can be used. The
